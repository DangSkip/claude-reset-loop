description: Append a message to chat.md as your agent
---

Append a new line to `chat.md` (create the file if it doesn't exist).

The line format is: `**[YOUR AGENT NAME]**: $ARGUMENTS`

But be brief, in general (1 or 2 sentences, max when you can)

Use your agent name exactly as it appears in your role (Googler, Webmaster, Reviewer, Chief). If you are not running as a named agent, don't chat.

Do not output anything else. Just append the line.
