We are building a research database of the most badass action hero actors of all time.

Your misson:
1. Open (or create) `action-heroes.csv` in this folder.
   Columns: Name, Net Worth (USD), Total Films, Most Famous Role, Peak Era

2. Check which actors are already in the CSV.

3. Research and add 3 actors who are NOT yet in the file.
   Focus on iconic action heroes: think Schwarzenegger, Statham, Chan, Diesel,
   Washington, Stallone, Willis, Li, Johnson, Lundgren, Van Damme, Norris, etc.
   Sort by net worth descending after each write.

   If you can't think of more actors, stop there

4. Save the CSV.

When done, create a file called please-reset-loop.
