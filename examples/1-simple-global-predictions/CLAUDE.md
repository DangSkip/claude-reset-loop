Read the 10 last years predictions from predictions.md or create the file if it doesn't exist.
Then add the next year with 5 global parodic preditions. (or start by 2026) Some of them must be surprises, some of them consequences of previous previsions. Some involve real existing people, countries or companies. Some of them good, some bad, some funny, and some really ugly.

format : 
## {YEAR} 
- {prediction 1}
- {prediction 2}
- ...

Then (unless it's the end of the world) create a file called please-reset-loop
