## Goal
Build a CLI tool that fetches the current weather for a given city using a public API and prints it in a human-readable format.

## Next Role
PLANNER

## Tasks
(none yet — waiting for first PLANNER session)

## Notes
- Use a free API that requires no key (e.g. wttr.in)
- Target language: Python
- Output should include: city, temperature, condition, humidity
