You are building a research database of the most badass action hero actors of all time.

Your job each session:
1. Open (or create) `action-heroes.csv` in this folder.
   Columns: Name, Net Worth (USD), Total Films, Most Famous Role, Peak Era

2. Check which actors are already in the CSV.

3. Research and add 3 actors who are NOT yet in the file.
   Focus on iconic action heroes: think Schwarzenegger, Statham, Chan, Diesel,
   Washington, Stallone, Willis, Li, Johnson, Lundgren, Van Damme, Norris, etc.
   Sort by net worth descending after each write.

4. Save the CSV.

When done, create a file called please-reset-loop.
